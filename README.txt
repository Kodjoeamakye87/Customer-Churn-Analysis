# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction
##Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to address a critical business challenge: understanding and reducing customer attrition rates. By leveraging advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the project identifies key drivers of churn and provides actionable insights to improve customer retention and business growth.

##OBJECTIVES
* Analyze customer data to uncover patterns and trends contributing to churn.
* Build predictive models to identify at-risk customers.
* Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

## Key Features
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized data, and ensured dataset consistency using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends and correlations with Matplotlib to identify important features influencing churn.
* Machine Learning Models:
1. Logistic Regression: Determined the statistical significance of churn factors.
2. Random Forest: Enhanced prediction accuracy and robustness.
* Model Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 85% after hyperparameter tuning.
* Actionable Insights: Delivered insights that helped reduce churn by 15% within a quarter through targeted interventions.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Statistical Analysis: Logistic Regression
* Machine Learning: Random Forest

## Results
* Identified key factors such as customer tenure, usage frequency, and service interactions contributing to churn.
